To solve the specificity issue, we can increase the specificity of the `.specific-class` selector or use the `!important` flag (use sparingly):  /* Solution 1: Increasing Specificity */ .container .specific-class {color: blue;} /* Solution 2: Using !important (use cautiously) */ .specific-class {color: blue !important;}  Choose the solution that best fits your CSS architecture.  Increasing specificity is generally preferred for maintainability.
