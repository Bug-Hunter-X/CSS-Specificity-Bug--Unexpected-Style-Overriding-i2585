The CSS code has a specificity issue where a more specific selector is overridden by a less specific one. This can cause unexpected styling issues. For instance, a style defined for a specific class might be unintentionally overridden by a more general selector that targets all elements of that type.  Example:  .specific-class {color: blue;} p {color: red;} If an element has both class 'specific-class' and is a paragraph tag, it will be red due to p having higher specificity.
